# Function-based Immutable Balanced Tree in Typescript

This module contains the implementation of a size-balanced binary tree,
which is the backing data structure for the [OrderedMap](orderedmap#OrderedMap) and [OrderedSet](orderedmap#OrderedSet) classes.

The OrderedMap and OrderedSet classes are easier to use, but the downside is current bundlers such as
webpack, esbuild, swc, etc. do not tree-shake classes.  Thus, this module exposes the tree as
a collection of functions so that if you wish you can use this directly and get the benefit of tree-shaking.
There is no additional functionality available in this module, so if you are already using the OrderedMap or
OrderedSet classes, there is no reason to use this module.

To use, import the functions from the tree module:

```ts
import * as tree from "@seedtactics/immutable-collections/tree";
```

### Data

<Export anchor="TreeNode" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/rotations.ts#L46">

```typescript
export type TreeNode<K, V> = {
  readonly key: K;
  readonly val: V;
  readonly size: number;
  readonly left: TreeNode<K, V> | null;
  readonly right: TreeNode<K, V> | null;
};
```

</Export>

<Summary>

A tree node with a key, value, and size

</Summary>

<Remarks>

This is the main data type of a balanced tree, and the type you should use in your own code when passing around
references to the tree.  You can directly access the `size` property to determine the number of elements in the tree.
(This module guarantees that the empty tree is always represented by `null`.)


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="MutableTreeNode" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/rotations.ts#L63">

```typescript
export type MutableTreeNode<K, V> = {
  key: K;
  val: V;
  size: number;
  left: MutableTreeNode<K, V> | null;
  right: MutableTreeNode<K, V> | null;
};
```

</Export>

<Summary>

A mutable tree node with a key, value, and size

</Summary>

<Remarks>

This should only be used during the initial building of the tree so that the tree can be built
efficiently.  After the tree is built, you should convert to the immutable `TreeNode` type and use
the various immutable adjustment operations.


</Remarks>

### Comparison Utils

<Export anchor="ComparisonConfig" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/comparison.ts#L210">

```typescript
export type ComparisonConfig<K> = {
  readonly compare: (a: K, b: K) => number;
};
```

</Export>

<Summary>

The configuration for a balanced tree

</Summary>

<Remarks>

A `ComparisonConfig` is passed to most functions manipulating the balanced tree data structure.  You only need one
`ComparisonConfig` per key type so you can store a single `ComparisonConfig` in a global variable per key type.
The [mkCompareByProperties](#mkCompareByProperties) function can help implement the compare function.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="mkComparisonConfig" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/comparison.ts#L251">

```typescript
function mkComparisonConfig<K extends OrderedMapKey>(): ComparisonConfig<K>
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Create a ComparisonConfig based on the key type

</Summary>

<Remarks>

This function is used to create a [ComparisonConfig](#ComparisonConfig) based on the type of key.  It supports
numbers, strings, booleans, dates, and objects which implement the [ComparableObj](#ComparableObj) interface.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="ComparableObj" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/comparison.ts#L30">

```typescript
export type ComparableObj = {
  compare(other: ComparableObj): number;
};
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Interface allowing custom key objects in an OrderedMap

</Summary>

<Remarks>

If you wish to use a custom object as a key in a HashMap or OrderedMap, you must implement the `compare` function.
The `compare` function should return a negative number if `this < other`, return zero if `this` equals `other`, and
return a positive number if `this > other`.  A common technique is to use subtraction to compare numbers
and [String.localeCompare](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare)
to compare srings.  Comparing multiple properties can either use a sequence of `if` statements or use `||` to combine.

<details>

<summary>Example</summary>

<div>

```ts
class SomeKey {
 public readonly a: number;
 public readonly b: string;
 constructor(a: number, b: string) {
   this.a = a;
   this.b = b;
 }

 compare(other: SomeKey): number {
   return (this.a - other.a) || this.b.localeCompare(other.b);
 }
}
```

</div>

</details>


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="mkCompareByProperties" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/comparison.ts#L133">

```typescript
function mkCompareByProperties<T>(
  ...getKeys: ReadonlyArray<ToComparable<T>>
): (a: T, b: T) => -1 | 0 | 1
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Combine multiple comparable properties into a single comparison function

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`mkCompareByProperties` will return a comparison function for the type `T` which
compares multiple properties in order.  Each property is specified by an
extraction function which extracts the property from the type `T`.  The comparison
function will compare each property in order, returning as soon as a single property is
not equal.  Strings are compared using
[localeCompare](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare).

This function can optionally be used to implement [ComparableObj](#ComparableObj), but typically
a direct implementation is shorter.  `mkCompareByProperties` is instead used primarily
by [LazySeq](lazyseq#LazySeq).

<details>

<summary>Example</summary>

<div>

```ts
type Foo = {
  readonly someNum: number;
  readonly someStr: string;
}

const compareFoo: (a: Foo, b: Foo) => -1 | 0 | 1 = mkCompareByProperties(
  f => f.someNum,
  { desc: f => f.someStr }
);

console.log(compareFoo(
  { someNum: 1, someStr: "Hello"},
  { someNum: 2, someStr: "Hello"}
)); // prints -1
console.log(compareFoo(
  { someNum: 42, someStr: "AAA"},
  { someNum: 42, someStr: "ZZZ"}
)); // prints 1 due to descending ordering of the strings
```

</div>

</details>


</Remarks>

### Lookup

<Export anchor="lookup" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L55">

```typescript
function lookup<K, V>(
  { compare }: ComparisonConfig<K>,
  k: K,
  root: TreeNode<K, V> | null
): V | undefined
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Lookup a key in the tree

</Summary>


<Export anchor="lookupMin" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L79">

```typescript
function lookupMin<K, V>(root: TreeNode<K, V>): readonly [K, V]
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Find the minimum key in the tree and return the key and value.

</Summary>


<Export anchor="lookupMax" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L96">

```typescript
function lookupMax<K, V>(root: TreeNode<K, V>): readonly [K, V]
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Find the maximum key in the tree and return the key and value.

</Summary>


### Modification

<Export anchor="alter" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L132">

```typescript
function alter<K, V>(
  { compare }: ComparisonConfig<K>,
  k: K,
  f: (oldV: V | undefined) => V | undefined,
  root: TreeNode<K, V> | null
): TreeNode<K, V> | null
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Insert, update or delete an entry in the tree

</Summary>

<Remarks>

Benchmarking showed that dedicated insert and remove functions were the same speed as a generalized
alter function, so we only implement alter (which helps bundle size as well).

`alter` first looks for the key in the tree.  The function `f` is then applied to the existing value
if the key was found and `undefined` if the key does not exist.  If the function `f`
returns `undefined`, the entry is deleted and if `f` returns a value, the entry is updated
to use the new value.

If the key is not found and `f` returns undefined or the key exists and the function `f` returns
a value `===` to the existing value, then the tree object instance is returned unchanged.

Runs in time O(log n)


</Remarks>

### Initial Construction

<Export anchor="mutateInsert" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L199">

```typescript
function mutateInsert<K, V, T>(
  { compare }: ComparisonConfig<K>,
  k: K,
  t: T,
  getVal: (old: V | undefined, t: T) => V,
  root: MutableTreeNode<K, V> | null
): MutableTreeNode<K, V>
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Insert mutably a key and value into a mutable tree

</Summary>

<Remarks>

This function is designed to only be used during the initial construction of
a tree from a network request or other data structure.
[from](#from) and [build](#build) internally use `mutateInsert` and are easier to use,
this is exported for advanced use.

An empty tree is represented as null and the tree will be mutated as values
are inserted.  The return value is the new root and the old root should not be referenced
again.  Once the tree is built, the type can be converted from [MutableTreeNode](#MutableTreeNode) to [TreeNode](#TreeNode).
Typically this should happen in a single function whose return value is [TreeNode](#TreeNode).


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="from" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L252">

```typescript
function from<K, V>(
  { compare }: ComparisonConfig<K>,
  items: Iterable<readonly [K, V]>,
  merge?: (v1: V, v2: V) => V
): TreeNode<K, V> | null
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Efficiently create a tree from a sequence of key-value pairs

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`from` efficiently creates a tree from a sequence of key-value pairs.  An optional `merge` function
can be provided.  When `from` detects a duplicate key, the merge function is called to determine
the value associated to the key.  The first parameter `v1` to the merge function is the existing value
and the second parameter `v2` is the new value just recieved from the sequence. The return value from the
merge function is the value associated to the key.  If no merge function is provided, the second value `v2`
is used, overwriting the first value `v1`.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="build" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L305">

```typescript
function build<K, V>(
  { compare }: ComparisonConfig<K>,
  items: Iterable<V>,
  key: (t: V) => K
): TreeNode<K, V> | null
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Efficently create a new tree

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`build` efficiently creates a tree from a sequence of values and a key extraction function.  If a
duplicate key is found, the later value is used and the earlier value is overwritten.  If this is
not desired, use the more generalized version of `build` which also provides a value extraction function.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="build2" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L322">

```typescript
function build<T, K, V>(
  { compare }: ComparisonConfig<K>,
  items: Iterable<T>,
  key: (t: T) => K,
  val: (old: V | undefined, t: T) => V
): TreeNode<K, V> | null
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Efficently create a new tree

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`build` efficiently creates a tree from a sequence of items, a key extraction function, and a value extraction
function.  The sequence of initial items can have any type `T`, and for each item the key is extracted.  If the key does not
yet exist, the `val` extraction function is called with `undefined` to retrieve the value associated to the key.
If the key already exists in the tree, the `val` extraction function is called with the `old` value to
merge the new item `t` into the existing value `old`.


</Remarks>

### Iteration

<Export anchor="iterateAsc" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L396">

```typescript
function iterateAsc<K, V, T>(
  f: (k: K, v: V) => T,
  root: TreeNode<K, V> | null
): IterableIterator<T>
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Iterates the entries in ascending order

</Summary>

<Remarks>

This function produces an [iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterator_protocol)
that applies the function `f` to each key and value in ascending order of keys and yields the results.  This iterator can be used only once, you must
call `iterateAsc` again if you want to iterate the tree again.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="iterateDesc" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L423">

```typescript
function iterateDesc<K, V, T>(
  f: (k: K, v: V) => T,
  root: TreeNode<K, V> | null
): IterableIterator<T>
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Iterates the entries in descending order

</Summary>

<Remarks>

This function produces an [iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterator_protocol)
that applies the function `f` to each key and value in descending order of keys and yields the results.  This iterator can be used only once, you must
call `iterateDesc` again if you want to iterate the tree again.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="foldl" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L451">

```typescript
function foldl<K, V, T>(
  f: (acc: T, k: K, v: V) => T,
  zero: T,
  root: TreeNode<K, V> | null
): T
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Reduce all the entries in the tree to a single value

</Summary>

<Remarks>

The letter-l in `foldl` stands for left.  Thinking of all the entries as an ascending list, `foldl` starts
combining entries from the left side.  Thus, the entry with the smallest key is combined with the zero value,
which is then combined with the next smallest key, and so on.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="foldr" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L483">

```typescript
function foldr<K, V, T>(
  f: (k: K, v: V, acc: T) => T,
  zero: T,
  root: TreeNode<K, V> | null
): T
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Reduce all the entries in the tree to a single value

</Summary>

<Remarks>

The letter-r in `foldr` stands for right.  Thinking of all the entries as an ascending list, `foldr` starts
combining entries from the right side.  Thus, the entry with the largest key is combined with the zero value,
which is then combined with the second-to-largest key, and so on.


</Remarks>

### Transformation

<Export anchor="mapValues" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L519">

```typescript
function mapValues<K, V1, V2>(
  f: (v: V1, k: K) => V2,
  root: TreeNode<K, V1> | null
): TreeNode<K, V2> | null
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Transform the values in the tree using a function

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`mapValues` applies the function `f` to each value and key in the tree and returns a new tree
with the same keys but the values adjusted to the result of the function `f`.  This can be done efficiently because
the keys are unchanged the arrangement of the tree is unchanged.
`mapValues` guarantees that if no values are changed, then the tree object instance is returned
unchanged.

This runs in O(n) time.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="collectValues" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L559">

```typescript
function collectValues<K, V1, V2>(
  f: (v: V1, k: K) => V2 | undefined,
  filterNull: boolean,
  root: TreeNode<K, V1> | null
): TreeNode<K, V2> | null
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Transform or delete the values in the tree using a function

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`collectValues` applies the function `f` to each value and key in the tree and uses the return value from
`f` as the new value.  If `f` returns undefined, the key and value is removed.  If `filterNull` is true and
`f` returns null, the key and value are also removed.
`collectValues` guarantees that if no values are changed, then the tree object instance is returned
unchanged.

This runs in O(n) time.


</Remarks>

### Views

<Export anchor="SplitResult" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L593">

```typescript
export type SplitResult<K, V> = {
  readonly below: TreeNode<K, V> | null;
  readonly val: V | undefined;
  readonly above: TreeNode<K, V> | null;
};
```

</Export>

<Summary>

The result of splitting a tree into keys above and below a given key

</Summary>


<Export anchor="split" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L610">

```typescript
function split<K, V>(
  { compare }: ComparisonConfig<K>,
  k: K,
  root: TreeNode<K, V> | null
): SplitResult<K, V>
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Split a tree on a key

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`split` splits a tree into keys below and above a given key.  The return type consists of
a balanced tree of all keys less than the given key, the value associated to the given key if
it exists, and a balanced tree of all keys greater than the given key.

Runs in O(log n) time.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="partition" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L650">

```typescript
function partition<K, V>(
  f: (k: K, v: V) => boolean,
  root: TreeNode<K, V> | null
): readonly [TreeNode<K, V> | null, TreeNode<K, V> | null]
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Partition a tree based on a boolean function

</Summary>

<Remarks>

The function `f` is applied to each key and value.  The entries for which `f` returns `true`
are placed in one tree and entries for which `f` returns false are placed in the other.
The two trees are returned as a tuple, with the `true` tree returned as the first
element of the tuple.

If the function `f` returns `true` for all entries, then the first tree object instance
is guaranteed to be === to the initial tree object instance.  Similar for if `f` returns `false` for
all entries.

This runs in O(n) time.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="ViewResult" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L681">

```typescript
function minView<K, V>(root: TreeNode<K, V>): ViewResult<K, V>
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Extract the minimum key and compute a balanced tree of all other values

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`minView` finds the minimum key and then removes it, producing a new balanced
tree of all other keys and values.  Both the removed key and value and the newly
balanced tree is returned.

Runs in O(log n) time, so can be used to efficiently pop the minimum key.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="maxView" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L713">

```typescript
function maxView<K, V>(root: TreeNode<K, V>): ViewResult<K, V>
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Extract the maximum key and compute a balanced tree of all other values

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`maxView` finds the maximum key and then removes it, producing a new balanced
tree of all other keys and values.  Both the removed key and value and the newly
balanced tree is returned.

Runs in O(log n) time, so can be used to efficiently pop the maximum key.


</Remarks>

### Bulk Modification

<Export anchor="union" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L730">

  root1: TreeNode<K, V> | null,
  root2: TreeNode<K, V> | null
): TreeNode<K, V> | null
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Returns a new tree which combines all entries in two trees

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`union` produces a new balanced tree which contains all the entries in both trees.  If a
key appears in only one of the two trees, the value from the tree is used.  If a key appears
in both trees, the provided merge function is used to determine the value.
`union` guarantees that if the resulting tree is equal to `root1`, then the `root1` object
instance is returned unchanged.

Runs in time O(m log(n/m)) where m is the size of the smaller tree and n is the size of the larger tree.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="intersection" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L795">

): TreeNode<K, V> | null
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Returns a new tree which contains only entries whose keys are in both trees

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`intersection` produces a tree which contains all the entries which have keys in
both trees.  For each such entry, the merge function is used to determine the resulting value.
`intersection` guarantees that if the resulting tree is equal to `root1`, then `root1` is returned
unchanged.

Runs in time O(m log(n/m)) where m is the size of the smaller tree and n is the size of the larger tree.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="difference" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/d509fa0fc452fd4fad4c1db1a540dd37adc2040b/src/data-structures/tree.ts#L844">

  cfg: ComparisonConfig<K>,
  root1: TreeNode<K, V1> | null,
  root2: TreeNode<K, V2> | null
): TreeNode<K, V1> | null
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Returns a new tree which contains only keys which appear in the first but not the second tree

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`difference` produces a tree which contains all the entries in `root1` where the key does
**not** exist in `root2`.  Can think of this as `root1 - root2` where the subtraction
is removing all the keys in `root2` from `root1`.  The values of the `root2` tree are ignored and
can be any value `V2`.
`difference` guarantees that if no entries are removed from `root1`, then `root1` object
is returned unchanged.

Runs in time O(m log(n/m)) where m is the size of the smaller tree and n is the size of the larger tree.

<Summary>

Return a tree which adjusts all the provided keys with a specified modification function.

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`adjust` is passed two trees: `root1` is the tree to modify and `root2` is the keys to adjust associated to helper
values of type `V2` (the type `V2` can be anything and does not need to be related `V1`).
For each key in `root2` to modify, `adjust` looks up the key in `root1` and then calls the function `f`
with the current existing value in `root1` (or `undefined` if the key does not exist) and the helper value from `root2`
associated with the key. The return value from `f` is set as the new value for the key, or removed if the return value is `undefined`.

`adjust` guarantees that if nothing was added, removed, or changed, then `root1` is returned.

Runs in time O(n + m) where n and m are the sizes of the two trees.
