# Function-based Immutable HashMap in Typescript

This module contains the implementation of the [HAMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie) data structure,
which is the backing data structure for the [HashMap](hashmap#HashMap) and [HashSet](hashset#HashSet) classes.

The HashMap and HashSet classes are easier to use, but the downside is current bundlers such as
webpack, esbuild, swc, etc. do not tree-shake classes.  Thus, this module exposes the HAMT data structure as
a collection of functions so that if you wish you can use the HAMT directly and get the benefit of tree-shaking.
There is no additional functionality available in this module, so if you are already using the HashMap or
HashSet classes, there is no reason to use this module.

To use, import the functions from the hamt module:

```ts
import * as HAMT from "@seedtactics/immutable-collections/hamt";
```

A note about size: the HAMT data structure nodes do not track the size of the tree.  Instead, each function
which modifies the tree returns a value to help track the size externally (for example, the intersection function returns
the size of the intersection).  Thus, if you need to know the size, you will need to store it somewhere else and
keep it updated as you modify the tree.  You can look at the source code for [HashMap](hashmap#HashMap) to see
how this is done.  Note that this module guarantees that `null` represents an empty tree,
so you can always check if the tree is empty or not by just comparing the root node to `null`.

### Data

<Export anchor="LeafNode" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L81">

```typescript
export type LeafNode<K, V> = { readonly hash: number; readonly key: K; readonly val: V };
```

</Export>

<Summary>

A leaf node with the hash, key, and value.

</Summary>

<Remarks>

Despite being exported to use if you wish, you don't need to access tree nodes directly,
the functions in this module manipulate the tree for you.  Thus it should be rare to need
to use this type.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="MutableLeafNode" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L91">

```typescript
export type MutableLeafNode<K, V> = { readonly hash: number; readonly key: K; val: V };
```

</Export>

<Summary>

A mutable version of the LeafNode with a mutable value.

</Summary>

<Remarks>

This should only be used during the initial building of the tree so that the tree can be built
efficiently.  After the tree is built, you should convert to the immutable `LeafNode` type.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="CollisionNode" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L104">

```typescript
export type CollisionNode<K, V> = {
  readonly hash: number;
  readonly collision: tree.TreeNode<K, V>;
};
```

</Export>

<Summary>

A collision node, which stores the colliding entries in a balanced tree

</Summary>

<Remarks>

The colliding nodes are stored in a [TreeNode](tree#TreeNode).

Despite being exported to use if you wish, you don't need to access tree nodes directly,
the functions in this module manipulate the tree for you.  Thus it should be rare to need
to use this type.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="MutableCollisionNode" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L117">

```typescript
export type MutableCollisionNode<K, V> = {
  readonly hash: number;
  collision: tree.MutableTreeNode<K, V>;
};
```

</Export>

<Summary>

A mutable collision node

</Summary>

<Remarks>

This should only be used during the initial building of the tree so that the tree can be built
efficiently.  After the tree is built, you should convert to the immutable `CollisionNode` type.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="InternalNode" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L135">

```typescript
export type InternalNode<K, V> = {
  readonly bitmap: number;
  readonly children: ReadonlyArray<Node<K, V>>;
};
```

</Export>

<Summary>

An internal node

</Summary>

<Remarks>

Despite being exported to use if you wish, you don't need to access tree nodes directly,
the functions in this module manipulate the tree for you.  Thus it should be rare to need
to use this type.

This implementation of the [HAMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie) breaks the
hash into 5-bit chunks. Thus, bitmap is a 32-bit bitmap which stores which children are non-null.
The non-null children are stored in the children array.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="MutableInternalNode" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L148">

```typescript
export type MutableInternalNode<K, V> = {
  bitmap: number;
  readonly children: Array<MutableNode<K, V>>;
};
```

</Export>

<Summary>

A mutable internal node

</Summary>

<Remarks>

This should only be used during the initial building of the tree so that the tree can be built
efficiently.  After the tree is built, you should convert to the immutable `InternalNode` type.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="Node" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L170">

```typescript
export type Node<K, V> = LeafNode<K, V> | CollisionNode<K, V> | InternalNode<K, V>;
```

</Export>

<Summary>

A HAMT tree node

</Summary>

<Remarks>

This is the main data type of the HAMT tree, and the type you should use in your own code when passing around
references to the tree.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="MutableNode" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L180">

```

</Export>

<Summary>

A mutable HAMT tree node

<Remarks>

This should only be used during the initial building of the tree so that the tree can be built
efficiently.  After the tree is built, you should convert to the immutable `Node` type.

### Hash Utils

<Export anchor="HashConfig" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hashing.ts#L84">

```typescript
export type HashConfig<K> = ComparisonConfig<K> & {
  readonly hash: (v: K) => number;
};
```

</Export>

<Summary>

The configuration for a HashMap

</Summary>

<Remarks>

This combines a [ComparisonConfig](tree#ComparisonConfig) with a hash function for the key type.

A `HashConfig` is passed to most functions manipulating the HAMT data structure.  You only need one
`HashConfig` per key type so you can store a single `HashConfig` in a global variable per key type.
The [hashValues](#hashValues) function can help implement the hash function if you do not have security
considerations.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="HashableObj" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hashing.ts#L43">

```typescript
export type HashableObj = {
  hash(): number;
};
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Interface allowing custom key objects in a HashMap

</Summary>

<Remarks>

If you wish to use a custom object as a key in a HashMap, you must implement the `hash` function
defined in the HashableObj type and the `compare` function defined in the [ComparableObj](#ComparableObj) type.
The hash value must be a 32-bit integer.  The [hashValues](#hashValues) function can help implementing
the hash function.

<details>

<summary>Example</summary>

<div>

```ts
class SomeKey {
 public readonly a: number;
 public readonly b: string;
 constructor(a: number, b: string) {
   this.a = a;
   this.b = b;
 }

 hash(): number {
   return hashValues(this.a, this.b);
 }

 compare(other: SomeKey): number {
   return (this.a - other.a) || this.b.localeCompare(other.b);
 }
}
```

</div>

</details>


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="hashValues" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hashing.ts#L146">

```typescript
function hashValues(
  ...vals: ReadonlyArray<
    string | number | boolean | Date | HashableObj | null | undefined
  >
): number
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Combine multiple hashable values into a single hash

</Summary>

<Remarks>

Useful helper function to hash multiple values to a single hash.
This uses the [FNV-1 hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function), which is
**NOT** secure.  If you need a secure hash, use something like [highwayhash](https://github.com/google/highwayhash#third-party-implementations--bindings)
and implement a custom [HashableObj](#HashableObj) interface.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="mkHashConfig" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hashing.ts#L205">

```typescript
function mkHashConfig<K extends HashKey>(): HashConfig<K>
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Create a HashConfig based on the key type

</Summary>

<Remarks>

This function is used to create a [HashConfig](#HashConfig) based on the type of key.  It supports
numbers, strings, booleans, dates, and objects which implement the [HashableObj](#HashableObj) interface.
Note that this uses [hashValues](#hashValues) and is thus NOT cryptographically secure.


</Remarks>

### Basic Operations

<Export anchor="lookup" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L221">

```typescript
function lookup<K, V>(
  cfg: HashConfig<K>,
  k: K,
  rootNode: Node<K, V>
): V | undefined
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Lookup a key in a HAMT

</Summary>


<Export anchor="insert" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L365">

```typescript
function insert<K, V>(
  cfg: HashConfig<K>,
  k: K,
  getVal: (v: V | undefined) => V,
  rootNode: Node<K, V> | null
): readonly [Node<K, V>, boolean]
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Insert or update a key and value in a HAMT

</Summary>

<Remarks>

This function lookus up the key and if it is found, the existing value is passed to `getVal`.
Otherwise, undefined is passed to `getVal`.  The return value from `getVal` is then placed
into the tree.  This function guarantees that if the return value from getVal is `===`
the existing the value, the tree is returned unchanged (and the tree root will be the exact same
object). The empty tree is represented by `null`.

This returns a tuple of the new tree after the operation and a boolean which is
true if the size has increased and false if the value overwrote an existing value and thus
the size of the tree didn't change.  You can use this to externally track the size of the tree.


</Remarks>

### Initial Building

<Export anchor="mutateInsert" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L522">

```typescript
function mutateInsert<K, T, V>(
  cfg: HashConfig<K>,
  k: K,
  t: T,
  getVal: (old: V | undefined, t: T) => V,
  rootNode: MutableNode<K, V> | null
): MutableNode<K, V>
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Mutably insert a key and value into a HAMT tree

</Summary>

<Remarks>

This function is designed to only be used during the initial construction of
a HAMT from a network request or other data structure.
[from](#from) and [build](#build) internally use `mutateInsert` and are easier to use,
this is exported for advanced use.

An empty tree is represented as null and the tree will be mutated as values
are inserted.  The return value is the new root and the old root should not be referenced
again.  Once the tree is built, the type can be converted from [MutableNode](#MutableNode) to [Node](#Node).
Typically this should happen in a single function whose return value is [Node](#Node).
See the source code of [from](#from) and [build](#build) for examples of size tracking.

If you wish to track the size, it must be done inside the `getVal` function.  If `getVal`
is passed undefined, then the size is increasing by one.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="from" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L638">

```typescript
function from<K, V>(
  cfg: HashConfig<K>,
  items: Iterable<readonly [K, V]>,
  merge?: (v1: V, v2: V) => V
): [Node<K, V> | null, number]
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Efficiently create a HAMT from a sequence of key-value pairs

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`from` efficiently creates a HAMT from a sequence of key-value pairs.  An optional `merge` function
can be provided.  When `from` detects a duplicate key, the merge function is called to determine
the value associated to the key.  The first parameter `v1` to the merge function is the existing value
and the second parameter `v2` is the new value just recieved from the sequence. The return value from the
merge function is the value associated to the key.  If no merge function is provided, the second value `v2`
is used, overwriting the first value `v1`.

The return value is a tuple of the new tree and the size of the tree.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="build" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L682">

```typescript
function build<K, V>(
  cfg: HashConfig<K>,
  items: Iterable<V>,
  key: (v: V) => K
): [Node<K, V> | null, number]
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Efficently create a new HAMT

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`build` efficiently creates a HAMT from a sequence of values and a key extraction function.  If a
duplicate key is found, the later value is used and the earlier value is overwritten.  If this is
not desired, use the more generalized version of `build` which also provides a value extraction function.

The return value is a tuple of the new tree and the size of the tree.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="build2" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L701">

```typescript
function build<T, K, V>(
  cfg: HashConfig<K>,
  items: Iterable<T>,
  key: (v: T) => K,
  val: (old: V | undefined, t: T) => V
): [Node<K, V> | null, number]
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Efficently create a new HAMT

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`build` efficiently creates a HAMT from a sequence of items, a key extraction function, and a value extraction
function.  The sequence of initial items can have any type `T`, and for each item the key is extracted.  If the key does not
yet exist, the `val` extraction function is called with `undefined` to retrieve the value associated to the key.
If the key already exists in the HAMT, the `val` extraction function is called with the `old` value to
merge the new item `t` into the existing value `old`.

The return value is a tuple of the new tree and the size of the tree.


</Remarks>

### Basic Operations

<Export anchor="remove" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L838">

```typescript
function remove<K, V>(
  cfg: HashConfig<K>,
  k: K,
  rootNode: Node<K, V> | null
): Node<K, V> | null
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Remove a key from a HAMT

</Summary>

<Remarks>

If the key exists, `remove` returns a new tree with the entry removed.  Otherwise, `remove` returns the
tree root node unchanged.  This can be used to track the size if you wish, decrement the size if the new root
is not `===` to the old root.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="alter" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L965">

```typescript
function alter<K, V>(
  cfg: HashConfig<K>,
  k: K,
  f: (oldV: V | undefined) => V | undefined,
  rootNode: Node<K, V> | null
): [Node<K, V> | null, number]
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Insert, change, or remove a key from a HAMT

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`alter` is a generalization of [lookup](#lookup), [insert](#insert), and [remove](#remove).
It can be used to insert a new entry, modify an existing entry, or
delete an existing entry.  `alter` first looks for the key in the map.  The function `f` is then
applied to the existing value if the key was found and `undefined` if the key does not exist.
If the function `f` returns `undefined`, the entry is deleted and if `f` returns a value, the
entry is updated to use the new value.

The return value is a tuple of the new root and the size change (either +1, 0, or -1).
If the key is not found and `f` returns undefined or the key exists and the function `f` returns
a value `===` to the existing value, then the root instance is returned unchanged.


</Remarks>

### Iteration

<Export anchor="iterate" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L1141">

```typescript
function iterate<K, V, R>(
  f: (k: K, v: V) => R,
  root: Node<K, V> | null
): IterableIterator<R>
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Iterates the entries in the HAMT

</Summary>

<Remarks>

This function produces an [iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterator_protocol)
that applies the function `f` to each key and value and yields the results.  This iterator can be used only once, you must
call `iterate` again if you want to iterate the tree again.  The order of iteration is undefined.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="fold" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L1167">

```typescript
function fold<K, V, T>(
  f: (acc: T, key: K, val: V) => T,
  zero: T,
  root: Node<K, V> | null
): T
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Reduce all the entries in the HAMT to a single value

</Summary>


<Export anchor="mapValues" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L1201">

```typescript
function mapValues<K, V1, V2>(
  f: (v: V1, k: K) => V2,
  root: Node<K, V1> | null
): Node<K, V2> | null
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Transform the values in a HAMT using a function

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`mapValues` applies the function `f` to each value and key in the HAMT and returns a new HAMT
with the same keys but the values adjusted to the result of the function `f`. `mapValues`
guarantees that if no values are changed, then the HAMT root node returned unchanged.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="collectValues" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L1269">

```typescript
function collectValues<K, V1, V2>(
  f: (v: V1, k: K) => V2 | undefined,
  filterNull: boolean,
  root: Node<K, V1> | null
): [Node<K, V2> | null, number]
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Transform or delete the values in a HAMT using a function

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`collectValues` applies the function `f` to each value and key in the HAMT, with the return value from `f` the new value
associated to the key.  If `f` returns undefined, the key and value is removed.  If `filterNull` is true and `f` returns null,
the key and value are also removed. If `filterNull` is false, null values are kept and only undefined values are removed.
`collectValues` guarantees that if no values are changed, then the root node is returned
unchanged.

The return value is a tuple of the new root node and size of the new HAMT.


</Remarks>

### Bulk Modification

<Export anchor="union" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L1389">

```typescript
function union<K, V>(
  cfg: HashConfig<K>,
  merge: (v1: V, v2: V, k: K) => V,
  root1: Node<K, V> | null,
  root2: Node<K, V> | null
): [Node<K, V> | null, number]
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Returns a new HAMT which combines all entries in two HAMTs

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`union` produces a new HAMT which contains all the entries in both HAMT.  If a
key appears in only one of the two maps, the value from the map is used.  If a key appears
in both maps, the provided merge function is used to determine the value.
`union` guarantees that if the resulting HAMT is equal to `root1`, then the `root1` object
instance is returned unchanged.

The return value is a tuple of the new root node and the size of the *intersection* (since
the algorithm can skip and not traverse sections of the tree that are not in both trees).
Thus, to compute the size after the union, the formula is `root1size + root2size - intersectionSize`.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="intersection" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L1634">

```typescript
function intersection<K, V>(
  cfg: HashConfig<K>,
  merge: (v1: V, v2: V, k: K) => V,
  root1: Node<K, V> | null,
  root2: Node<K, V> | null
): [Node<K, V> | null, number]
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Returns a new HAMT which contains only entries whose keys are in both HAMTs

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`intersection` produces a HAMT which contains all the entries which have keys in
both HAMTs.  For each such entry, the merge function is used to determine the resulting value.
`intersection` guarantees that if the resulting HAMT is equal to `root1`, then `root1` is returned
unchanged.

The return value is a tuple of the new HAMT and the size of the intersection, so the number of entries in the new HAMT.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="difference" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L1830">

```typescript
function difference<K, V1, V2>(
  cfg: HashConfig<K>,
  root1: Node<K, V1> | null,
  root2: Node<K, V2> | null
): readonly [Node<K, V1> | null, number]
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Returns a new HAMT which contains only keys which appear in the first but not the second HAMT

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`difference` produces a HAMT which contains all the entries in `root1` where the key does
**not** exist in `root2`.  Can think of this as `root1 - root2` where the subtraction
is removing all the keys in `root2` from `root1`.  The values of the `root2` HashMap are ignored and
can be any value `V2`.

The return value is a tuple of the HAMT root and the number of entries removed from `root1`.
`difference` guarantees that if no entries are removed from `root1`, then `root1` object
is returned unchanged.


</Remarks>

<Export anchor="adjust" src="https://github.com/SeedTactics/immutable-collections/blob/51cb410e92845cb870d6c8385cdc1395b2721aff/src/data-structures/hamt.ts#L2043">

```typescript
function adjust<K, V1, V2>(
  cfg: HashConfig<K>,
  f: (v1: V1 | undefined, v2: V2, k: K) => V1 | undefined,
  root1: Node<K, V1> | null,
  root2: Node<K, V2> | null
): readonly [Node<K, V1> | null, number]
```

</Export>

<Summary>

Return a HAMT which adjusts all the provided keys with a specified modification function.

</Summary>

<Remarks>

`adjust` is passed two HAMTs: `root1` is the HAMT to modify and `root2` is the keys to adjust associated to helper
values of type `V2` (the type `V2` can be anything and does not need to be related `V1`).
For each key in `root2` to modify, `adjust` looks up the key in `root1` and then calls the function `f`
with the current existing value in `root1` (or `undefined` if the key does not exist) and the helper value from `root2`
associated with the key. The return value from `f` is set as the new value for the key, or removed if the return value is `undefined`.

The return value is a tuple of the HAMT root and the number of keys removed.  Note the number of keys removed can be negative if
nodes were added to the HAMT.  `adjust` guarantees that if nothing was added, removed, or changed, then `root1` is returned.
